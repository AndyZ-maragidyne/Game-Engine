# Game Engine built in C++ using SDL2

## Key features:
- networking between a client and server with Zeromq
- component based entity system
- event management system

## How to play games
Each of the three games are made using the game engine. To compile the program, all that needs to be done is open the solution file through MS Visual Studio and run the program through the MSVC compiler. 

All SDL include files and libraries are included in the zip as well as any necessary 0mq files and are accessed through relative file paths.
